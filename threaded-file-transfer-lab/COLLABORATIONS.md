# Collaborations

* emphaticDemo - much of this implementation is based on the emphaticDemo
  provided by the instructor. threadClient and threadServer are modified
  versions of framedThreadServer and framedThreadClient. The framed send and
  recieve methods as well as the stammer proxy are from emphaticDemo as well.
