# Collaborations

* emphaticDemo - much of this implementation is based on the emphaticDemo
  provided by the instructor. threadClient and threadServer are modified
  versions of framedThreadServer and framedThreadClient; it has been modified
  to send files instead of echoing.

* The send and
  recieve methods as well as the stammer proxy are directly from emphaticDemo as well.
